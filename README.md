# Anomely-detection
Introduction:
Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, called outliers. It has many applications in business, from intrusion detection (identifying strange patterns in network traffic that could signal a hack) to system health monitoring (spotting a malignant tumor in an MRI scan), and from fraud detection in credit card transactions to fault detection in operating environments.

In this jupyter notebook we are going to take the credit card fraud detection as the case study for understanding this concept in detail using the following algorithm:

1.solation Forest Anomaly Detection Algorithm

2.Density-Based Anomaly Detection (Local Outlier Factor)Algorithm

3.Support Vector Machine Anomaly Detection Algorithm

Credit Card Fraud Detection

Problem Statement:
The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. This model is then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. Our aim here is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.

DataSet :
The dataset that is used for credit card fraud detection is derived from the following Kaggle URL :
